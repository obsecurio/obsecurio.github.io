When the core has been reset, it will commence execution at the location of the reset vector in
the exception vector table (at either address 0x00000000 or 0xFFFF0000)

- In a multi-core system, enable non-primary cores to sleep

- Initialize exception vectors.

- Initialize the memory system, including the MMU.

- Initialize core mode stacks and registers.

- Initialize any critical I/O devices.

- Perform any necessary initialization of NEON or VFP.

- Enable interrupts.

- Change core mode or state.

- Call the main() application.
